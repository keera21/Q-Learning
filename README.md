This project is a custom GridWorld environment developed in Python using Pygame, featuring an intelligent agent trained with Q-learning. The environment includes obstacles, a start position, and a goal state. At the beginning of training, the agent moves randomly and inefficiently. However, after training over 300 episodes, the agent successfully learns the optimal path to reach the goal quickly and reliably by updating a Q-table. The project includes a graphical interface to visualize the agent's learning process in real-time and supports saving/loading of the Q-table to avoid retraining. This project was developed to deepen my understanding of reinforcement learning and its applications in robotics and autonomous navigation.
